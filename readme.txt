Course: LU2IN018 - Advanced C

University: Sorbonne University


Description:

This project is a simulation of a dynamic ecosystem where different entities interact in an environment that evolves over time. The world is self-generated and governed by ecological rules:

- Predators hunt prey to survive.
- Prey feed on grass and move to avoid predators.
- Grass grows randomly on the terrain, serving as food for prey.
- The world evolves dynamically, with cycles of reproduction, survival, and species extinction based on available resources.


Content:

This project includes exercises and implementations in Advanced C, covering fundamental concepts of low-level and system programming:

Dynamic memory management
Advanced file manipulation
Complex data structures (lists, trees, etc.)
System programming (processes, threads, signals)
